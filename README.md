# SVG-Loco-Logo-Maker

A LOGO generator using Node.js.

## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 10 Challenge - \
"10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker"

In order for my work to show what I can do, I used Node.js,  Inquirer package, Jest, and other stuff to complete the following User Story and A/C:

User Story: \
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

Acceptance Criteria: \
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Usage

My final version of the work mirrors the UT Challenge source file/code, acceptance criteria, rubric, and video submission.

## Credits

I usually credit Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own code without any impediments, on this one. So I did not need his help whatsoever.

I referenced code from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my node.js application.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue and my code generated the necessary logo.svg.
